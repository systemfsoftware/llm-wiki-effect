/**
 * Per-project async mutex.
 *
 * Why this exists: multiple ingest and Save-to-Wiki entry points can mutate
 * shared project files such as `wiki/index.md`, `wiki/log.md`, page bodies,
 * and ingest caches. Those read-modify-write operations must not overlap.
 *
 * Expensive source preparation may run concurrently, but commit sections use
 * this mutex so queue, Save-to-Wiki, and deep-research writes take turns.
 *
 * The lock is a simple promise chain. No timeouts, no fairness, no
 * re-entrancy detection — those would all be overkill. If `fn`
 * hangs, the lock is held until it resolves; we'd rather have
 * back-pressure than corruption.
